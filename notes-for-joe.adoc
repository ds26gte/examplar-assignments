= Notes

== Debug notes

link:./parley-debug.adoc[] contains notes on error messages
seen.

== Location of modified assignment folders

The `local/` directory contains the modified versions of the
legacy assignments. Essentially, I took the legacy assignment
folder, kept the chaffs/ and wheats/ subfolders, created a
test.arr, modified all the gdrive pathnames to relative pathnames
(since the requested files are all here), and made sure that the
*.arr files all have `include cpo` if needed.

I've put the `filesystem` assignment there for now. Will add the
others after I re-run them.
